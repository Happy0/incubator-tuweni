# Releasing Tuweni

This guide comprises of all the steps to prepare, run a release and follow up on the next steps.

## One-time setup

Open the file `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` and add the following information:

```
asfNexusUsername=${asf LDAP id}
asfNexusPassword=${asf LDAP password}
signing.keyId=${GPG key ID}
signing.gnupg.keyName=${GPG key ID}
```

Make sure your computer has gpg utilities installed. Follow the [Gradle signing plugin's GPG agent](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#sec:using_gpg_agent) instructions to set up.

## Branch into a release branch

Create a new release branch formed with the `major.minor` version numbers (see [semver](https://semver.org/) for glossary). For `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` version, the release branch will therefore be `1.0`.

```
git checkout -b 1.0
git push origin 1.0
```

For patch releases, use the existing release branch.

## Prepare the release

Change the README file to update version numbers to the new release. Make a commit ($commitId) to the release branch and push.

## Running the release

### Build the artifacts

Set up the version strategy:
```
export BUILD_RELEASE=true
```

Build the artifacts
```
./gradlew build
```

Check the sha512 signatures match
```
shasum -a 512 dist/build/distributions/tuweni-bin-${RELEASE VERSION}.tgz
shasum -a 512 dist/build/distributions/tuweni-bin-${RELEASE VERSION}.zip
shasum -a 512 dist/build/distributions/tuweni-src-${RELEASE VERSION}.tgz
shasum -a 512 dist/build/distributions/tuweni-src-${RELEASE VERSION}.zip
shasum -a 512 dist/build/distributions/tuweni-gossip-${RELEASE VERSION}.tgz
shasum -a 512 dist/build/distributions/tuweni-gossip-${RELEASE VERSION}.zip
```

Sign and publish
```
export ENABLE_SIGNING=true
./gradlew publish
```

This checks the code, the licenses, runs all the tests and creates all the artifacts (binaries, sources, javadoc).

This also publishes the artifacts to repository.apache.org in a staging repository.

### Push the distribution to dist.apache.org staging area

If necessary create the folder:
```
svn mkdir -m "Add new Tuweni folder for release ${RELEASE VERSION}" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/tuweni/${RELEASE VERSION}
```

Check out the folder locally:
```
svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/tuweni/${RELEASE VERSION} _staged
```

Delete contents of the folder if necessary.
```
TODO
```

Copy the distribution artifacts to it - make sure to change the name to ${RELEASE VERSION}-incubating:

```
cp dist/build/distributions/tuweni-${RELEASE VERSION}.zip _staged/tuweni-${RELEASE VERSION}-incubating.zip
cp dist/build/distributions/tuweni-${RELEASE VERSION}.tgz _staged/tuweni-${RELEASE VERSION}-incubating.tgz
```

Commit the changes
```
cd _staged
svn add tuweni-*
svn ci -m "Add Apache Tuweni ${RELEASE VERSION} release candidate"
```

### Tag the git repository

```
git tag -m "Release ${RELEASE VERSION}" v${RELEASE VERSION}
git push origin 1.0 --tags
```
